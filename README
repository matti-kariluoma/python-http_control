http_control sets up a webpage interface to the internals of your
python application (caveat emptor!).

No external dependencies are need to use this module. If the (optional)
packages python-zeroconf and python-netifaces are installed, network
service auto-discovery is enabled.

To enable zeroconf/Bonjour auto-discovery:
# prerequisites for optional functionality, debian-like
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
# may need to exit shell and open a new one
$ sudo pip install zeroconf netifaces
